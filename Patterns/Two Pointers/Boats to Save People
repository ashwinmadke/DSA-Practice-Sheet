Approach : two pointers + greedy
TC - O(n log n)
SC - O(1)

public int numRescueBoats(int[] people, int limit) {
        
        // Step 1 : sort the array, so that light weight and heavy weight people can be seperated
        Arrays.sort(people);

        //Step 2 : apply two pointers
        // pair lightweight (left) and heavyweight (rigth) people
        // and check if they can be placed into boat or either of them
        
        int left = 0;
        int right = people.length-1;
        int boats = 0;

        while(left <= right){
            //both placed
            if(people[left] + people[right] <= limit){
                left++; 
            }
            // heavy person only can go into boat
            right--;

            boats++; // increase num of boats
        }
        return boats;
    }
